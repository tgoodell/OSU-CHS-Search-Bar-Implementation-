# OSU-Search-Bar-Implementation-
Code for integrating a search bar onto the OSU Center for Health Sciences website (https://health.okstate.edu/library/). This searchbar will then redirect the user to the OSU Ex Libris library repository site (https://okla-am.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?query=&vid=OKSTAT&tab=default_tab&queryTemp=cancer&sortby=rank&lang=en_US). 

The searchbar is meant to replace the two headers and two paragraphs, however it should be able to be integrated anywhere. 

The only issue that I have found is an aesthetic one: for whatever reason, the links "Advanced Search", "Databases", "Full Text Journals", and "WorldCat" are not underlined when they are hovered over with the mouse. This searchbar is heavily based off of the one on the OSU Library Website (https://library.okstate.edu/). The underline issue is the only inconsistancy and I will probably fix it in the near future.
